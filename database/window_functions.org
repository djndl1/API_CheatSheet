#+TITLE: Window Functions

Window functions are computed over a range of rows but give results for each row.

#+begin_src sql
<function_name>([<expression>]) over (
    [partition by <expression> [{, <expression>} ...]]  --- supported by all Window Functions
    [order by <expression> [ASC | DESC] [{, <expression>}...]] --- supported by all Window Functions
    [{ROWS | RANGE} {<frame_start> | <frame_between> }]
           --- define a frame that is then used by the function to compute a result on the rows in the frame
           --- the frame moves with the current row, further bounded by the partition section
           --- the most powerful feature of Window Functions
)
