#+TITLE: Sql General

* Background

** Relationnal Model

Data are represented as sets of tables. Redundant data is used to link records in different tables.

Normalization: refining a database design to ensure that each independent piece of information is in only one place

*** Terms

- *Entity*: something of interest to the database user community

- *Result Set*: a nonpersistent table, generally the result of an SQL query

- schema statement, data statement, transaction statement

*** Execution Process

1. Check permissions on the statement and data

2. Check the syntax

3. Query optimizer determines the most effective way to execute the query and picks an *execution plan*

* Query

** Tables

- Permanent Tables (=create table=)

- Derived tables (rows returned by a subquery and held in memory)

- temporary tables (volatile data held in memory)

- Virtual tables (=create view=)

** Recent Learned Syntax

- =order by position_number=

 #+begin_src sql
select c.first_name, c.last_name,r.rental_date
from customer c
inner join rental r
on c.customer_id = r.customer_id
ORDER BY 3 asc;
 #+end_src
