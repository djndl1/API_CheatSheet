# Users and Security

https://www.ibm.com/developerworks/data/library/techarticle/dm-0508wasserman/

1. User and group authentication is managed in a facility external to DB2 (the OS, a domain controller or a Kerberos security system), different from other RDBMSs. Both the user and group definition are defined outside of DB2. There are no users in DB2 that are not OS users.

2. DB2 stores asnd maintains user and groop authorization information internally.
