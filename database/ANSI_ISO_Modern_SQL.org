** General Concepts

*** Relational Database

A relational database consists of tables, a table is not a relation, but the
only difference between them is that a table may have rows with duplicate row
values, duplicates should be avoided regardless, therefore
all relational databases should consist of relations. (a table is
sometimes called a multiset to distinguish it from a regular set).

* Later Standards

** SQL-16

- SQL now understands JSON. SQL/JSON path query language
