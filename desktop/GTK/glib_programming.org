** The =g_malloc()= Family

Various typed and untyped wrappers around =malloc= and =realloc=. Must be used
with =g_free()=.

- =g_clear_pointer()=: a useful helper to clean up a generic resource.

- =g_steal_pointer()=: not very useful for common C scenarios (useful only to
  save some typing), but typically
  with =g_autoptr=.
