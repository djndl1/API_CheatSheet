#+title: Pretty Good Privacy, OpenPGP and Similar Software

Encryption program that provides crytographic privacy and authentication for
data communication, used for signing, encrypting and decrypting texts, files,
directories and whole disk partitions.

* Basic Cryptography Concepts

- /Asymmetric Cryptography/ :: with two keys so that key transfer is safe. An
  encrypted message is only read by the private key holder. Conversely, if the
  message is encrypted with the private key, the public key holders can be
  assured that the message is from the private key holder since no one else has
  the private key. With two pairs of keys, one party has two keys: the private
  for authentication and the public for encryption.

- /Diffie-Hellman Key Exchange/ :: Keys are not exchanged but created in both parties.
