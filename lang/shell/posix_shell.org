#+title: Posix Shell

* History

- Thompson Shell (Ken Thompson, Unix Version 1 throughout 6), modeled after the Multics shell =RUNCOM=,
  hence the =rc= configuration.

- Bourne Shell (Stephen Bourne, Unix Version 7). There are some modern alternatives:
  + Almquist Shell (ash), a clone of the original Bourne shell (FreeBSD, NetBSD, Busybox, dash)
  + Bourne-Again Shell: the GNU shell as a superset, the default interactive
    shell on most Linux distros.
  + KornShell (ksh), the POSIX shell is a subset of Korn shell, an enhanced
    version the Bourne shell.
  + Public domain Korn shell (pdksh)
    - MirBSD Korn shell (mksh), used by Android as =/system/bin/sh=.
  + Z shell: a relatively modern shell compatible with bash.

- C shell: modelled after the C programming language. The TENEX C shell as an
  improved version is a modern alternative.
