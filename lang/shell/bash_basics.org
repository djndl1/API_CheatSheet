#+title: Bash Basics

* Features Particular to Bash

- =[[= conditional

- shell arithmetic with one of the shell expansions or =let=

- =alias= and =unalias=: aliases are expanded upon a command/function is read.

- one-dimensional non-contiguous array variable declared by =declare=

- directory stack with =pushd=, =popd=, and =dirs=

- POSIX mode =set -o posix=, =--posix= or the envvar =POSIXLY_CORRECT= makes =bash= try to behave as compliant as possible
to the POSIX stnadard.

- restricted shell: certain operations and features are disallowed or disabled

* Startup Files

A shell may be a login shell or a non-login one and interactive or
non-interactive at the same time.

- Login Shells
  + =/etc/profile=
  + =~/.bash_profile=, =~/.bash_login=, =~/.profile=: first readable file is read
  + =~/.bash_logout= upon logout

- Non-Login Shells
  + =~/.bashrc=

- Non-Interactive Shell reads an additional =BASH_ENV= file
  + a shell may be non-interactive and login or non-login. So it may reads
    =/etc/profile= and others.

- As =sh=
  + =/etc/profile=
  + =~/.profile=

* Interactive Shells

echo =$-= to check if the current shell is interactive (the result contains an
=i=).
An interactive shell has some features enabled:

- /job control/ enabled

- prompts are set

- commands are read from the command line with =readline=

- the =ignoreeof= option is checked instead of exiting immediately upon EOF.

- /command history/ and /history expansion/ enabled

- /alias expansion/ enabled

- in the absence of traps, =SIGTERM= is ignored, =SIGINT= is caught and handled.

- =SIGHUP= to all jobs on exit is configured with =huponexit=.

- Redirection errors of built-in commands do not cause the shell to exit

- Failure of =exec= do not exit the shell.

- Parser syntax errors do not cause the shell to exit.
