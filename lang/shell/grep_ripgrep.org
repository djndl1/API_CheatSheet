* Frequent Options

- =-F=: treat the pattern as literal strings instead of regular expressions.

- =-i=: ignore case

- =-v= (invert): get lines other than those matching the pattern

- =-n=: line number; =-H=/â€‹=-h= for enabling/disabling filenames per lline.

- =-c=: count matching lines for each input file, no more piping to =wc -l=

- =-m=: limits matching lines

- =-e=: multiple =-e= can specify multiple search strings (OR logic) from the command line. For AND-logic multiple patterns without piping, use =awk= or =sed=.

- =-l=, =-L= (list filenames): list matching/non-matching filenames.

- =-w= (word): the matching lines must have the matched parts as whole words.

- =-Fxf=: with these three options together, it is possible to get common lines between two lines or the difference with =-v= added: that is, use one file as the pattern to match against the other in whole lines and in literal strings.
