#+title: Sed

=sed= receives text input, performs certain operations on specified lines (specified by address range) of the input,
one line at a time then outputs the result.

#+begin_src sed
[address-range]/p # print address range
[address-range]/d # delete
s/pattern1/pattern2/ # substitute the first instance
[address-range]/s/pattern1/pattern2/ # substitute over address-range
[address-range]/y/pattern1/pattern2/ # replace any character in pattern1 with the corresponding character in pattern2 over address-range (similar to `tr`)
[address] i/a pattern Filename        # insert/append pattern at address indicated in file Filename
g                                   # operate on every pattern match witin each matched line of input
#+end_src

#+begin_src shell
sed -e '/^$/d' $filename # sed explicitly adds commands
sed -n # -n outputs lines only explicitly selected for output; otherwise every line is printed along with those matched.
