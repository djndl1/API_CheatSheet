#+title: Awk

A sequence of patterns and actions that tell what to look for in the input data
and what to do when it's found. A set of files arae searched for lines matched by
any of the patterns and the corresponding action is performed on a matching line.

* Basics

- Pattern-action statement: =pattenr { action }=. Each awk program is a sequence of one or more pattern-action statements.

#+begin_src awk
ip a | awk '$1 == "inet" { print $2} '
awk -f programFile inputfiless...
#+end_src

- =$1=, =$2= ... fields; =$0= the entire line; =NF=: the number of fields; =$NF=: the last field. Any expression can be used after =$= to denote a field number; =NR=: number of lines

#+begin_src awk
{ print } # or
{ print $0 }
#+end_src

- the C-style =printf= format print is also supported.
