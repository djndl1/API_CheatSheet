# Cargo and related

`Cargo.lock` ensures reproducible builds by recording versions of the dependencies when first building, instead of resolving dependencies whenever building. `cargo update` bypasses this.

# Guessing game

```rust
use std::io; // bring in `std::io` library
use rand::Rng;
use std::cmp::Ordering;

fn main() {
    println!("Guess the number!");  // a macro

    let secret_number = rand::thread_rng().gen_range(1, 101);

    //println!("The secrete number is: {}", secret_number);

    // make an infinite loop
    loop {
        println!("Please input your guess.");

        // `let` creates a variable. `mut` makes it mutable.
        // `new` an associated function (static method) of `String` type
        let mut guess = String::new();

        // `&` indicates a reference
        io::stdin().read_line(&mut guess)
            .expect("Failed to read line");
        // `read_line` returns an `io::Result` type, an enumeration type (`Ok` or `Err`).
        // An error handling mechanism

        // convert the string to a u32
        let guess: u32 = match guess.trim().parse() { // `: type` annotates this as `u32`
            Ok(num) => num,
            Err(_) => continue,     // `_` a catchall value
        };

        println!("You guessed: {}", guess);

        // returns a variant of the `Ordering` enum
        match guess.cmp(&secret_number) {
            Ordering::Less => println!("Too small!"), // an arm
            Ordering::Greater => println!("Too big"), // pattern
            Ordering::Equal => {
                println!("You win!");
                break; // break out the loop
            }
        }
    }
}

```


# Basic Concepts

## Mutability

To ensure safety and easy concurrency, by default variables are immutable. `mut` makes a variable mutable. Constants are declared using `const` and its type must be annotated.

```rust
const MAX_POINTS: u32 = 100_000;
```

A new variable with the same name as a previous variable shadows the previous one.

The compiler can usually infer what type we want to use based on the value and how we use it. In cases when many types are possible, we must add a type annotation:

## Data Types

```rust
let guess: u32 = "42".parse().expect("Not a number");
```

### Scalar Types

- integer: `i8`, `u8`, `i16`, `u16`, `i32`, `u32`, `i64`, `u64`, `i128`, `u128`, `isize`, `usize` (word-length); Octal is denoted by `0o`, binary `0b`, byte `b'A'`. If overflow occurs, Rust performs two's complement wrapping.

- floating-point: `f32`, `f64` (default), conforming to IEEE 754

- booleans: `bool`. Rust will not automatically try to convert non-Boolean types to a Boolean.

- characters: `char`, single quote, four bytes Unicode

### Compound Types

- `tuple`: a general way of grouping together some number of other values with a variety of types

```rust
let tup: (i32, f64, u8) = (500, 6.4, 1);
let (x, y, z) = tup; // destructuring
let five_hundred = x.0;
let six_point_four = x.1;
let one = x.2;
```

- `array`: every element of an array must have the same type; allocated on the stack

```rust
let a = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5];
let b: [i32; 5] = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5];
let a = [3; 5]; // an array of five 3s

let first = a[0];
let second = a[1];
```

Rust does array boundary check.

## Control Flow

- `if`: too many `else if` can be replaced by `match`. Since `if` is an expression:

```rust
let number = if condition {
    5
} else {
    6
};
```

Blocks of code evaluate to the last expression in them.

- `loop`: infinite loop; a loop can return a value:

```rust
fn main() {
    let mut counter = 0;

    let result = loop {
        counter += 1;

        if counter == 10 {
            break counter * 2;
        }
    };

    println!("The result is {}", result);
}
```

- `while`

- `for`: iterate over a collection:

```rust
    let a = [10, 20, 30, 40, 50];

    for element in a.iter() {
        println!("the value is: {}", element);
    }
```

## Functions

Function bodies are made up of a series of statements optionally ending in an expression. Function definitions, variable creations are statements. Calling a function/macro is an expression, blocks of code are expressions.

```rust
let y = {
    let x = 3;
    x + 1       // expressions do not include ending semicolons
} // evalutes to 4
```

```rust
fn func_name(param1: param_type1, param2: param_type2) -> return_type {
    // function body
}
```

```rust
fn plus_one(x: i32) -> i32 {
    x + 1
}
```

# Ownership

__Ownership__ is the central feature of Rust. Memory is managed through a system of ownership with a set of rules that the compiler checks at compile time.

- Each value has a variable called its _owner_;

- There can only be one owner at a time;

- When the owner goes out of scope, the value will be dropped.

Assignment in Rust by default moves a value (Stack-only data are copied). Rust will never automatically create deep copies of data. If deep copy is needed, use a common method `clone`.

Rust has a special annotation `Copy` trait that indicates that a type is placed on stack only. If a type has the `Copy` trait, an older variable is still usable after assignment. All basic numeral types, `bool`, `char`, tuples of `Copy` types are of `Copy` trait.

Passing a variable to a function will move or copy. Returning values can also transfer ownership, which follows the same pattern.

References allow for referring to some value without taking ownership of it. `&var` creates a reference that refers to `var`. The value will not be dropped when the reference goes out of scope. The signature of the function uses `&` to indicate the type of the parameter is a reference. Having references as function parameters is called _borrowing_. References are immutable by default.

```rust
fn calculate_length(s: &String) -> usize {
    s.len()
}

fn change_string(s: &mut String) {
    s.push_str(" World!");
}

```

However, you can have only one mutable reference to a particular piece of data in a particular scope. This can prevent data races. Also, we cannot have a mutable reference while we have an immutable one. A reference's scope starts from where it is introduced and continues through the last time that reference is used (not just block scope).

```rust
// totally legal
fn main() {
    let mut s = String::from("hello");

    let r1 = &s; // no problem
    let r2 = &s; // no problem
    println!("{} and {}", r1, r2);
    // r1 and r2 are no longer used after this point

    let r3 = &mut s; // no problem
    println!("{}", r3);
}
```

```rust
fn main() {
    let mut s = String::from("hello");

    let r1 = &s; // no problem
    let r2 = &s; // no problem
    
    println!("{} and {}", r1, r2);
    // r1 and r2 are no longer used after this point

    let r3 = &mut s; // no problem
    // s.push_str("abc");  E0499
    r3.push_str("efg");
    println!("{}", r3);
    s.push_str("abc"); // okay
}
```

In Rust, the compiler guarantees that references will never be dangling references. The compiler will ensure that the data a reference points to will not go out of scope before the reference to the data does.

```rust
fn no_dangle() -> String {
    let s = String::from("Dangling");
    s
}


fn dangles() -> &String {
    let s = String::from("Dangling");
    &s
}
```

- A _string slice_  is a reference to part of a `String`:

```rust
let mut s = String::from("hello world");

    let hello = &s[0..5];
    let world = &s[6..11];

    let len = s.len();
    let slice = &s[3..len];
    let slice2 = &s[3..];
    let slice3 = &s[0..len];
    let slice4 = &s[..];
    
    //  String slice range indices must occur at valid UTF-8 character boundaries. 
```

```rust
fn first_word(s: &String) -> &str{
    let bytes = s.as_bytes();

    for (i, &item) in bytes.iter().enumerate() {
        if item = b' ' {
            return &s[0..i];
        }
    }
    &s[..]
}

fn main() {
    let mut s = String::from("hello world");
    let word = first_word(&s);
    s.clear();      // 
    println!("the first word is: {}", word);
}
```

```bash
error[E0502]: cannot borrow `s` as mutable because it is also borrowed as immutable
 --> rust_scratchpad.rs:4:5
  |
3 |     let word = first_word(&s);
  |                           -- immutable borrow occurs here
4 |     s.clear();
  |     ^^^^^^^^^ mutable borrow occurs here
5 |     println!("the first word is: {}", word);
  |                                       ---- immutable borrow later used here
```

String literals are slices. `&str` makes a string slice used as a parameter.

# Structs

## Definition and Instantiation

```rust
struct  User {
    // fields
    username: String,
    email: String,
    sign_in_count: u64,
    active: bool,
}

fn main() {
    let mut user1 = User {
        email: String::from("someone@email.com"),
        username: String::from("someusername"),
        sign_in_count: 1,
        active: true
    };
    user1.email = String::from("someother@email.com");

    let user2 = build_user(String::from("another"), String::from("another@email.com"));
    let user3 = User {
        ..user2
    };
    let user4 = User {
        username: String::from("user4"),
        ..user3
    };
}

fn build_user(email: String, username: String) -> User {
    User {
        username,
        email,
        sign_in_count: 1,
        active: true,
    }
}
```

Structs can be defined in a similar way to tuples, called _tuple structs_.

```rust
struct Pixel(u8, u8, u8);
    let blackpoint = Pixel(0, 0, 0);
    let Pixel(red, green, blue) = blackpoint; // destructuring
```

- Unit-like struct: structs without any data, used to implement a trait.

Itâ€™s possible for structs to store references to data owned by something else, but to do so requires the use of _lifetimes_.

- `Debug` trait output:

```rust
#[derive(Debug)]
struct Rectangle {
    width: u32,
    height: u32,
}

fn area(rectangle: &Rectangle) -> u32{
    rectangle.height * rectangle.width
}

fn main() {
    let rect1 = Rectangle {width: 30, height: 50};
    println!("{:#?}", rect1);
}
```

```bash
Rectangle {
    width: 30,
    height: 50,
}
```

```rust
#[derive(Debug)]
struct Rectangle {
    width: u32,
    height: u32,
}

impl Rectangle {
    fn area(&self) -> u32{
        self.height * self.width
    }

    fn can_hold(&self ,other: &Rectangle) -> bool {
        self.width > other.width && self.height > other.width
    }

    fn square(size: u32) -> Rectang
    le{
        Rectangle {width: size, height: size}
    }
}
```

It is possbile to separate these methods into multiple `impl` blocks.

# Enums and Pattern Matching

```rust
enum IpAddr {
    V4(String),
    V6(String),
}

let home = IpAddr::V4(String::from("127.0.0.1"));

let loopback = IpAddr::V6(String::from("::1"));
```

Each variant can have different types and amount of associated data.

```rust
enum IpAddr {
    V4(u8, u8, u8, u8),
    V6(String),
}
```


```rust
enum Message {
    Quit,
    Move { x: i32, y: i32 }, // anonymous struct
    Write(String),
    ChangeColor(i32, i32, i32), // three i32
}
```

Enums can have their methods:

```rust
impl Message {
    fn call(&self) {
        // method body would be defined here
    }
}
```

Expressing a concept in terms of the type system means the compiler can check whether a case is handled the way it should be. Rust doesnâ€™t have the null feature that many other languages have. Rust does not have nulls, but it does have an enum that can encode the concept of a value being present or absent. This enum is `Option<T>`.  Everywhere that a value has a type that isnâ€™t an `Option<T>`, you can safely assume that the value isnâ€™t null.

## `match` Control Flow Operator

Patterns can be made up of literal values, variable names, wildcards and many other things.

```rust
#[derive(Debug)] // so we can inspect the state in a minute
enum UsState {
    Alabama,
    Alaska,
    // --snip--
}

enum Coin {
    Penny,
    Nickel,
    Dime,
    Quarter(UsState),
}

fn value_in_cents(coin: Coin) -> u8 {
    match coin {
        Coin::Penny => 1,
        Coin::Nickel => 5,
        Coin::Dime => 10,
        Coin::Quarter(state) => {
            println!("State quarter from {:?}!", state);
            25
        },
    }
}
```

With `Option<T>`: 

```rust
fn plus_one(x: Option<i32>) -> Option<i32> {
    match x {
        None => None,
        Some(i) => Some(i + 1),
    }
}

let five = Some(5);
let six = plus_one(five);

let none = plus_one(None);
```

Rust also has a pattern `_` we can use when we donâ€™t want to list all possible values and `()` (unit value) when doing nothing.

```rust
let some_u8_value = 0u8;
match some_u8_value {
    1 => println!("one"),
    3 => println!("three"),
    5 => println!("five"),
    7 => println!("seven"),
    _ => (),
}
```

## `if let`

The `if let` syntax combines `if` and `let` into a less verbose way to handle values that match one pattern while ignoring the rest.

```rust
if let Some(3) = some_u8_value { // not an assignment
    println!("three);
}
```

```rust
let mut count = 0;
if let Coin::Quarter(state) = coin {
    println!("State quarter from {:?}!", state);
} else {
    count += 1;
}
```

is equivalent to

```rust
let mut count = 0;
match coin {
    Coin::Quarter(state) => println!("State quarter from {:?}!", state),
    _ => count += 1,
}
```

# Common Collections

The data that collections point to is stored on the heap.

```rust
let mut v = Vec::new();
    v.push(12.0);

    let mut v2 = vec![1, 2, 3];
    v2.push(5);
    v2.push(6);

    let v3 = vec![1, 2, 3, 4, 5];

    let third: &i32 = &v[2]; // unsafe
    println!("{}", third);

    match v3.get(2) {   // safe access, return None if not available
        Some(third) => println!("The third element is {}", third);
        None => println!("There is no third element.", );
    }
```

With `enum`, we can store multiple types in a vector:

```rust
enum SpreadsheeCell {
    Int(i32),
    Float(f64),
    Text(String)
}

fn main() {
    let row = vec![
        SpreadsheeCell::Int(3),
        SpreadsheeCell::Text(String::from("blue")),
        SpreadsheeCell::Float(10.12),
    ];
}
```

Rust needs to know what types will be in the vector at compile time so it knows exactly how much memory on the heap will be needed to store each element.
