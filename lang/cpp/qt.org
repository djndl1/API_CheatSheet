** Basic Qt Widgets

Layouts and spacers are not something that can be directly observed 
but they can affect the positions and orientations of widgets. 
Qt programs don't typically lay elements out using the fixed position 
because layouts allow dialogs and windows to be dynamically resized 
in a sensible manner while handling a varying length of text 
when localized in different languages.
