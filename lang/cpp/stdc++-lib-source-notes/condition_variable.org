Condition variables provide synchronization primitives used to block a thread until notified by some other
thread that some condition is met or until a system time is reached.

Condition variables permit concurrent invocation of the =wait=, =wait_for=, =wait_until=, =notify_one= and
=notify_all= member functions.
