#+title: FreeBASIC

Unfortunately, FB has a C-style header system.

The reason why =False= is =-1= is because (Free)BASIC uses bitwise operator
=Not=. The complement of full =0=​s is full =1=​, which is =-1=.

By default, string literals are not escaped unless prefixed with =!=.

* QuickBASIC

* OOP

The OOP part of the language is basically a C++03 imitation.

- In addition to normal constructors, there are default constructor (with no
  arguments) and copy constructors.

- a =This= parameter is available in a member procedure/function.

- an object is destroyed (with its destructor called) upon going out of scope.

- =Public=, =Private=, =Protected= work the same way as in C++ to the point of
  syntax similarity.

- VB-style properties are allowed in FreeBASIC, including indexed properties.
