#+title: FreeBASIC

Unfortunately, FB has a C-style header system.

The reason why =False= is =-1= is because (Free)BASIC uses bitwise operator
=Not=. The complement of full =0=​s is full =1=​, which is =-1=.

By default, string literals are not escaped unless prefixed with =!=.

* QuickBASIC

* OOP

The OOP part of the language is basically a C++03 imitation.
