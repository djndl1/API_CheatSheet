#+TITLE: Vb Classic

In the era of [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rapid_application_development][Rapid Application Development]]

1. Heavily integrated with COM/OLE, (=String= is OLE =BSTR= and arrays are =SAFEARRAY=)

2. Primarily used for Windows GUI apps

3. Use refcount for memory management

4. Compiled to P-code or native code

5. Supported on up to Windows 10

6. Poor support on OOP and limited threading capability

* Language Variants

1. VBA: for application scripting, still COM/OLE based

2. VBScript: COM-based Windows scripting language for automation and web page (succeeded by PowerShell)

3. GAMBAS: a FOSS variant mainly on Linux


* Form Lifecycle

1. =Initialize=: variables are initialized

2. =Load=: properties and controls are references. The windows and its child controls are created

3. =Resize=: visible or sized changed

4. =Activate=: ready to accept user input

5. =Deactivate=: end user switches to another form

6. =Paint=: the form refreshes itself

7. =QueryUnload=

8. =Unload=

9. =Terminate=: deallocate the memory for the Form

Forms expose a special property, the =Controls= collection, which contains all the controls that are currently loaded on the form itself.

* Basics

1. =Set= is there only to assign object reference

2. =Variant= can be used as a =Result<T, E>=, returning the result when no error and an error number if needed.

3. =TypeName= returns the name of the type as a =String=
