#+title: VB Classic COM/C Interoperation

VB Classes are themselves COM objects.

* Invoking C Functions

VBA may invoke external C functions with the =stdcall= calling convention.

#+begin_src vba
[Private/Public] Declare [ptrsafe] Sub void-func-name Lib "libname" [Alias "symbolname"] [(parameters)]
[Private/Public] Declare [ptrsafe] Function func-name Lib "libname" [Alias "symbolname"] [(parameters)] [function-type]
#+end_src

- =PtrSafe= is introduced in VB7 to assert that a =Declare= statement targets
  64-bit development environments.


#+begin_src vba
Private Declare Function WaitForSingleObject Lib "kernel32" _
    (ByVal hHandle As Long, ByVal dwMilliseconds As Long) As Long
Private Declare Function OpenProcess Lib "kernel32" (ByVal dwAccess As _
    Long, ByVal fInherit As Integer, ByVal hObject As Long) As Long
Private Declare Function CloseHandle Lib "kernel32" _
    (ByVal hObject As Long) As Long

' Wait for a number of milliseconds, and return the running status of a
' process. If argument is omitted, wait until the process terminates.
Function WaitForProcess(taskId As Long, Optional msecs As Long = -1) _
    As Boolean
    Dim procHandle As Long
    ' Get the process handle.
    procHandle = OpenProcess(&H100000, True, taskId)
    ' Check for its signaled status; return to caller.
    WaitForProcess = WaitForSingleObject(procHandle, msecs) <> -1
    ' Close the handle.
    CloseHandle procHandle
End Function
#+end_src

* Exposing VB API

VB API=s are exposed as COM servers and thus only public class modules are exposed.

* .NET Interop and COM

**  Issues

- Somehow, VBA loads .NET 2-3.5 even if .NET 4 typelib is referenced. It needs a
  =appname.exe.config= with the following configuration.

  #+begin_src xml
  <configuration>
    <startup useLegacyV2RuntimeActivationPolicy="true">
      <supportedRuntime version="v4.0"/>
    </startup>
  </configuration>
  #+end_src

  See [[http://web.archive.org/web/20130128072944/http://www.marklio.com/marklio/PermaLink,guid,ecc34c3c-be44-4422-86b7-900900e451f9.aspx][What is useLegacyV2RuntimeActivationPolicy for?]]. This disables in-process
  side-by-side of different .NET versions and uses the specified version.

  #+begin_quote
  All these have a “single runtime per process” view of the world, so we try to
  make those codepaths believe they still exist in that world by “unifying” the
  version that they see.  After a given version has been chosen by one of these
  codepaths, that’s the version that all of them see for the remainder of the
  process lifetime.  Additionally, all of these activation paths had some kind of
  roll-forward semantics associated with them.
  #+end_quote

  This reason why by default .NET 2.0 is loaded is backward compatiblity:

  #+begin_quote
  We “cap” those semantics at v2,
  meaning by default none of these codepaths see v4 at all.  This allows us to
  claim that installing v4 is “non-impactful”.
  #+end_quote

- By default, .NET =ComVisible= types' generated class interfaces derive from =IDispatch=
  + Exposed .NET interfaces are by default dual unless overriden by =InterfaceTypeAttribute=;

- =System.Object= has a default property =ToString=

- [[https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/visualstudio/code-quality/ca1402?view=vs-2022&tabs=csharp][Method overloading]]

- [[https://marc.info/?l=ms-dcom&m=103440425612266&w=2][IUnknown Support]]
  + VBA supports holding an =IUnknown= pointer with =Variant= (=vbDataObject=)
  + =CreateObject= can return an =IUnknown= pointer to a =Variant= variable.
  + These pointers are not of much use except for passing around.

** Useful =mscorlib= classes

- =System.Random=.

- =System.Type= is returned as =mscorlib.[_Type]=

- =ArrayList=, =Queue=, =HashTable=, =Stack=, =SortedList=
  + - =For Each ... Next= works as long as the object variable is an
    =IEnumerable=. The enumerating element has to be a =Variant= as
    =System.Collections.IEnumerator= is marshaled as =IEnumVARIANT=,
    see [[https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/standard/native-interop/type-marshalling][Type Marshaling]].

- Various =*Calendar=

- =UTF8Encoding=, =ASCIIEncoding=

- =StringBuilder= works but overloading makes it hard to find the correct method name.

- Various crytographic classes


* Microsoft Scripting Runtime

Windows-builtin COM library.
