#+title: VB Classic Gui Programming

in VB6, controls can be classified into (1) /Standard Controls/, managed by the
Windows OS, and the (2) /Lightweight Controls/, handled by the VB runtime itself.

* Form Properties

- =Tag=: VB extender properties that is always available, no specific use,
  stores any object related to that control.

- =hWnd=: the internal handle used by Windows to identify a control, available
  only to standard Windows controls.

- =Enabled=, =Visible=: disabled controls don't react to user's actions.
  Invisible controls are automatically disabled. All mouse events for disabled or invisible controls are passed to the underlying container or to the form itself.

* Form Lifecycle

1. =Initialize=: triggered where variables are initialized; before the actual window and the
   controls are created

2. =Load=: triggered when properties and controls are referenced. The windows
   and its child controls are created. Graphical operations will not work.
   A form is visible after its =Show= method is called.

3. =Resize=: visible or sized changed

4. =Activate=: ready to accept user input

5. =Deactivate=: end user switches to another form

6. =Paint=: the form refreshes itself (fired only if =AutoRedraw= is =False=)

7. =QueryUnload=: =OnClosing=

#+begin_src vba
' refuse to unload
Private Sub Form_QueryUnload(Cancel As Integer, _
    UnloadMode As Integer)
    ' Don't let the user close this form.
    Select Case UnloadMode
        Case vbFormControlMenu, vbAppTaskManager
            Cancel = True
    End Select
End Sub
#+end_src

8. =Unload=: a last chance to prevent the closure of the form

#+begin_src vba
' This is a module-level variable.
Dim Saved As Boolean

Private Sub Form_Unload(Cancel As Integer)
    If Not Saved Then
        MsgBox "Please save data first!"
        Cancel = True
    End If
End Sub
#+end_src

9. =Terminate=: deallocate the memory for the Form

Forms expose a special property, the =Controls= collection, which contains all the controls that are currently loaded on the form itself.

* Form Events

- =Click=, =DblClick=: triggered not only by actual mouse clicks.

- =GetFocus=, =LostFocus=

- =Change=: its behavior is not consistent across VB controls. Not available for =CheckBox= and =OptionButton=, which fires a
  =Click= event when its content is changed.

- =KeyPress=, =KeyDown= (the key translated into ANSI numeric code), =KeyUp=: Only keys that correspond to control keys (Ctrl+x, BackSpace, Enter, and Escape) and printable characters activate the =KeyPress= event.

- =MouseDown=, =MouseUp=, =MouseMove=: mouse button state, Shift/Ctrl/Alt state
  and the cursor's location are passed.

* The =Controls= Collection

Container of all the controls currently loaded on the form itself.
