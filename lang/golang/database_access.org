#+title: Database Access

* Relation DBMS

Normally, =sql.DB= (connection pool) manages read/write without using an explicit connection.
The user specifies a driver and connection information (often in the form of a
connection string) and open such a =sql.DB=. Use =sql.Conn= for dedicated connections.

Use =defer= to close =sql.DB=, =sql.Rows=, =sql.Conn= and rollback =sql.Tx=.
