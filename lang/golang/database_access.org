#+title: Database Access

* Relation DBMS

Normally, =sql.DB= (connection pool) manages read/write without using an explicit connection.
The user specifies a driver and connection information (often in the form of a
connection string) and open such a =sql.DB=. Use =sql.Conn= for dedicated connections.

Use =defer= to close =sql.DB=, =sql.Rows=, =sql.Conn= and rollback =sql.Tx=.

Transactions should be used if a set of operations (use temporary tables,
setting variables) requires running on the same
connection as a transaction holds the same connection throughout the lifetime.

A prepared statement is bound to a database connection under the hood, but
=sql.DB= will try to reprepare it if the prepared one has lost its connection.
Frequent repreparation of statements may consume too many resources and reach
the limit of the database. Prepare a statement and use it immediately and avoid
any form of repreparation.
