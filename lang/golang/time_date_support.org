#+title: Time Date Support

* =time= Package

The standard =time= pacakge revolves around =Time=, =Duration= and =Location= and meets
basic needs.

=Time= is a combination of Gregorian wall clock time without leap seconds and monotonic time with reasonable
utility methods and supports time zone, UTC and local time. However, it is an
time instant, not a date or a clock time.

=Duration= (=int64=) has a limit of around 290 years.
