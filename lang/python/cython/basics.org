#+title: Basics

Cython is Python with C data types. Code which manipulates Python values and C
values can be freely intermixed. Refcount maintenance and error checking of
Python operations is automatic and Python error handling system is also available.

* Building

- =pyx= cython source files are first compiled to C source files and then built
  as a shared library.

- the library is then imported into a Python session.

- The most common way to build cython code is a setuptool =setup.py= (~python
  setup.py build_ext --inplace~); other ways
  include =cythonize=, =Pyximport= or jupyter notebooks.

* First Example

#+include: "./hello_world/setup.py" src python
