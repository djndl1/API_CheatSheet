=venv= creates a virtual environment directory tree similar to that of a typical
python installation with a few special scripts that activate/deactivate the
environment.

On activation, it points =sys.prefix= and =sys.exec_prefix= to the virtual
environment
while keeping =sys.base_prefix= and =sys.base_exec_prefix= where it used to be.

A =venv= environment is not portable.

Do use =python -m pip= on Windows for safety.
