* =numbers= abstract base classes

A =numbers.Number= class is the root of the numeric hierarchy. Any numeric type
is a =Number=. Numeric objects are immutable. Python's string representations of numbers
are convertible to the value it represents and they have no leading or trailing
zeros and are in base 10.

Builtin numeric classes are =int= (inheriting from =numbers.Integral=,
in turn from =numbers.Rational=), =bool= (from =int=) , =float= (from =nubmers.Real=) and =complex=
(from =numbers.Complex=)

** Builtin Numeric Types

*** =bool=

Not type-safe, unfortunately a subclass of =int=.
