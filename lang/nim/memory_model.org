#+TITLE: Memory Model

* Two ways to organize memory

- stack:

- heap

In Nim all data is stored on stack unless =new()= proc is used to allocate memory on the heap, which returns a reference to the object.

* Nim's Way

** A few Utility Method

- =addr(x)=, =unsafeAddr(x)=: the address =ptr T= of variable =x=

- =sizeof(x)=: the size of variable =x= in bytes

- =typeof(x)=: returns the string representation of the type of variable =x=

- dereference =[]=: =p[]= 30, similar to =*p = 30= in C.
  + dereferencing is automatic for object or tuple access when using =.= access operator.

References are traced while pointers are not.

** How Nim Stores Data

- Scalars are usually kept on the tack.

- =seq= and =tuple= are like C++ types, a handle on the stack and the resource on the heap.
