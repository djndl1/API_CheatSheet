* Service Provider Interfaces

- *Service*: a well-known interface or class for which zero, one or many service providers exist.

- *Service Provider*: a class that implements or subclasses the well-known interface or class.
  + configured and identified through a provider file in ~META-INF/services/~
  + installed in the form of a ~JAR~ in the classpath.

- ~ServiceLoader~: an object that locates and loads service providers deployed in the runtime environment.

Application ncode refers only to the service and is assumed to be capable of choosing between multiple service providers.

Java has already provided some SPIs in ~java.util.spi~.
