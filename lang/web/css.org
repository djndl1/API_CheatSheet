#+title: Css

Rules that specify the content of an element should appear. CSS applies rules to HTML elements,
which governs how the content of specified elements should be displayed.

#+begin_src css
p { /* selector: the elements to which rules are applied, with some advanced rules */
    font-family: Arial; /* declarations: property: value */
}
#+end_src

If two selectors are the same, the last one is applied. If one is more specific,
it is applied.

Certain properties can be inherited by child elements while some others are not.
