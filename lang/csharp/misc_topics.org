* Loop Variable with Closures

C# closure captures variables, not their values, unlike Java, where variables
must be =final= and captured by values.

Starting from C# 5, =foreach='s loop variable is now declared inside the loop,
and thus a closure captures a new variable each loop. =for='s behavior remains
the same.
