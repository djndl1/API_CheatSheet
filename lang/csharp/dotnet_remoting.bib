	abstract = {This title shows developers how to build Internet-based, distributed applications using Microsoft .NET Remoting, which enables powerful remote interaction among objects. A fundamental understanding of .NET Remoting is crucial as developers shift to developing distributed, Internet-based applications. Until recently, DCOM was the preferred method for developing distributed applications on Microsoft platforms. But as this book demonstrates, the .NET Remoting architecture is much easier to use and extend than DCOM. The book covers all aspects of .NET Remoting, including in-depth coverage of the .NET Remoting architecture plus concrete examples, best practices, and performance tips to show how to extend and customize the framework.

    Provides developers with deep design and implementation guidance to help them build better distributed applications on the Microsoft .NET Framework
    One third of the book introduces readers to the basics of using .NET Remoting to develop distributed application
    Two-thirds of the book covers advanced features of .NET Remoting plus details on how to extend and customize the framework},
