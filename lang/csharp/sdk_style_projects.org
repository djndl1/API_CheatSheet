#+title: Sdk Style Projects

* WinForms and Resources

- Dotnet SDK 3.0 introduces a new [[https://github.com/dotnet/msbuild/issues/4704][way]] to embed a resource file. If the project
  targets the old netframework, without
  =<GenerateResourceUsePreserializedResources>true</GenerateResourceUsePreserializedResources>=
  and referencing =System.Resources.Extensions=, it won't build with =dotnet
  (ms)build= and The old =msbuild.exe= would use the old way to embed a file.

- There is another [[https://github.com/dotnet/runtime/issues/39078][problem]] that causes no =System.Resources.Extensions.dll= not
  found at runtime. This requires binding autoredirects.

- The old Netframework project uses =DependentUpon= for each resource file. If
  this is not set, then a convention is used. In Sdk-style projects, a new
  [[https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/core/resources/manifest-file-names#embeddedresourceusedependentuponconvention-property][default convention]] is introduced. Without setting
  =<EmbeddedResourceUseDependentUponConvention>true</EmbeddedResourceUseDependentUponConvention>=,
  the app may not be able to find resources during runtime. Also see this [[https://github.com/dotnet/msbuild/issues/5793][issue.]]

* VSTest

- Runsettings's =DotNetHostPath= is misspelled in the documentation due to source code naming.
  + This is required to be set under PRoot distros.
