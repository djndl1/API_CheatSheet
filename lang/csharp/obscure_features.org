* =ref= variable and =ref= return values

TODO

 `ref` locals are initialized to refer to a particular variable, and can’t be modified to refer to a different variable. When declaring a reference local variable, initialization is required. `ref` locals are typicall used to refer to values returned by `return ref`.

 ```csharp
 ref int rbyref(ref int c)
    {
        int a = 5;
        ref int b = ref a;
        return ref c;
    }
 ```

A by-reference-returning method must return a reference, even if it does not need to. The only workaround is to throw an exception.

Declaring a field of type ref isn’t allowed.
