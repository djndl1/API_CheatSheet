* How Rust works

Three Rules

- Each value has a variable called its /owner/.
- There can only be one owner at a time
   + by default Rust moves value to another owner when assigning unless
     the object has implemented the =Copy= trait.
- When the owner goes out of scope, the value will be dropped

#+begin_src rust
  fn main() {
      let s1 = String::from("hello");
      let s2 = s1; // by default move the resource of s1 to s2,
      // a consequence of rule 2, even if deep-copy,
      // is safe here, it is expensive after all

      // compile error, s1 is not the owner of the string and thus invalid
      println!("{}, world!", s1);
  }
#+end_src

Implicit deep copy requires an implementation of the =Copy= trait and
no =Drop= method.

The semantics for passing a value to a function are similar to
those for assigning a value to a variable.
Passing a variable to a function will move or copy depending on the
function signature and the argument type, but basically the same
rule for the assignment.

** Using a value without transferring ownership: Reference

/Borrowing/: the action of creating a reference.

- At any given time, you can have either one mutable reference
  or any number of immutable references.

- References must always be valid.

1. a reference is by default immutable (to the pointed value).

2. unless specified both in the signature and the user's code

3. /Only one mutable reference to a particular piece of data at a time/
   (derived from Rule 2) to prevent /data races/.

4. One cannot have a mutable reference and an immutable one to the same
   value at the same time.

** Use slices to reference a part of a collection

This keeps variables about part of a collection in sync with the collection's owner:
slices are references to a contiguous sequence.

- One reference per resource :: allowing a single variable, struct field, or
  array element to hold each resource.

- *ownership transfer* :: still, references (pointers, handles, mutexes and
  other copyable resources) must be assignable so that functions
  can be used. References are assigned in a restricted way.
  + when a pointer is assigned, the old one is discarded (set to a default
    invalid value) and no
    longer used. Thus, all pointers are either valid or =NULL=.
  + as long as a reference is passed into a function, that resource is no longer
    managed by the caller and in theory shouldn't be worried over.

- *borrowing* :: to simplify access to a resource without having to invalidate a
  variable first and then reacquire that reference, non-owning
  references are allowed. Creating a non-owning reference to a resource is called
  *borrowing*. A reference may be either *owning* or *borrowing* a resource.
  + =&= may be seen as an indication of borrowing except when creating the first
    reference â€“ if the address is taken, then that resource must already exist
    and hence be owned.
  + =&*= may be used when borrow-assign a pointer to indicate a borrowing.
  + the borrowed resource may be assumed to be valid for the duration of the
    borrower.
  + Borrows are weak references and should never outlive the value that they
    points to.
  + one may typedef a pair of =resource_reftype_owned= and =resource_reftype_borrowed= for a reference
    type to explicit indicate such difference.

#+begin_quote
The pointer ownership model (POM) can statically
identify certain classes of errors involving dynamic
memory in C programs. The model works by requiring
the developer to identify responsible pointers; these are
the pointers whose objects must be explicitly freed
before the pointers themselves may be destroyed. POM
can be statically analyzed to ensure that the design is
consistent and secure, and that the code correctly
implements the design.

** Pointer/Resource Categories

- /Responsible/ pointers (owner): responsible for freeing its pointed-to object
  A responsible pointer might be in the following states
   + /good/: safe to dereference and must be freed after use
   + /null/: may be freed but with no effect
   + /uninitialized/: with no value
   + /zombie/: a pointer whose value has been transferred or freed.
     Zombie pointers must not be dereferenced or freed.

- /Irresponsible/ pointers (borrower):

- /Out-of-scope/ pointers: not applied to by this model. Refcounted, GCed, circular linked list
  An Out-of-scope pointer shall not be assigned the value of a responsible pointer

- A struct is responsible if it contains any responsible pointers, or it
   contains any other responsible objects. A responsible object is good if
   all of its responsible pointers are good or null. A responsible object
   is zombie if none of its responsible pointers are good. A responsible
   object is inconsistent if it is either good nor zombie.

** Basic Pointer Rules

1. Every object on the heap must be referenced by exactly one responsible
   pointer.

2. Irresponsible pointers can point anywhere but cannot free anything.

3. The subtypes of pointer variables never changes: once a responsible pointer, always a responsible pointer.
   the state of responsible pointers can change in the following ways
   + assignment (write of a responsible pointer into another responsible pointer)
   + producer return value or as a producer argument
   + consumer argument (giving up ownership)

4. Any function that modifies the state of an object must not exit with
   the object in an inconsistent state.

** Function Category

1. /no-return function/

2. /producer function/: a function that produces a responsible object, =malloc=, =strdup=

3. /consumer function/: a function that frees or transfer a responsible object
   e.g. =realloc=

** Argument Types

- /producer argument/ or /producer return value/: an argument or return value that takes ownership

- /consumer argument/: an argument whose ownership will be taken or freed

- /irresponsible pointer argument/: it is permissible to pass any pointer

- /forced irresponsible pointer argument/: a pointer-to-pointer argument, not for modifying the memory or consuming it,
  but the value of the original pointer might be modified.
  A responsible pointer must not be passed as a forced-irresponsible pointer argument.

** Ownership Rules:

- Ownership can be transferred from one responsible pointer
   to another, leaving the old one a unusable end-of-lifetime 'zombie' pointer.
   (Basic Rule 1)

- An irresponsible pointer is not an owner
  + should never be a producer argument =**T= or producer return value (a pointer value representing a new resource) (Basic Rule 3)
  + should never be a consumer argument (the function would either free the pointed data or give it to some other responsible pointer) (Basic Rule 3)
  + should never be copied over to a responsible pointer (this basically implies that the resource now has two owners) (Basic Rule 1)

#+begin_src c
  char *irp = irp_init_val;
  irp = malloc(5);

  char *irp = irp_init_val;
  free(irp);

  char *rp;
  char *irp = irp_init_val;
  rp = irp; // bad
  memcpy(&rp, &irp, sizeof(rp)); //bad
#+end_src

- A responsible pointer can only be assign the following value:
  + =NULL= (nullify the pointer after ownership transfer, being freed or for proper initialization)
  + another responsible pointer (ownership transfer)
  + a producer return value (or as an argument) (ownership transfer)

- An /uninitialized responsible/ pointer's value shall never be /copied/ to
  an /irresponsible pointer/ ,/consumed/, /dereferenced/.

- A /good responsible/ pointer shall never be overwritten,
  go out of scope while good.

- A /zombie responsible/ pointer shall never be assigned, consumed or dereferenced.

- A conversion to integer from a responsible pointer can be considered
  an implicit assignment to an irresponsible pointer and then conversion to an integer.
