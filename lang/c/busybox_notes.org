#+title: Busybox Notes

* Version 0.32

** Entry

The first argument is parsed to get the applet name. However, if the name is
=busybox= with additional arguments, additional arguments should be parsed to
find the actual applet to call. =busybox_main= checks if there are additional
arguments. If any, =main= is called again with the rest of the arguments. The
first argument into =main= is now the second argument on the command line.
=busybox= is not a valid applet thus =busybox_main= should not be called twice:
it is only meant to dump help info or parse the second argument.

** =cat=

The implementation is simple to understand: the only problem is that it
increments =argc= twice while printing files on the command line.
