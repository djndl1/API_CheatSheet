#+title: Library Implementation

* Design Issues

- Generality: too general, too hard to use or inefficient for their intended purposes

- Simplicity: too simple, risk not satisfying the demands of applications that
  might use them; too confusing, no one uses them.

- Efficiency

  #+begin_quote
 Tuning a program to make it faster almost always makes it bigger,
 more difficult to understand, and more likely to contain errors. Thereâ€™s
 no point in such tuning unless measurements of execution time show
 that the program is too slow. A program needs only to be fast enough,
 not necessarily as fast as possible.
 ...
 Reliability is more important than efficiency.
 ...
 Straightforward implementations of inherently fast algorithms are better than
 hand-tuned implementations of slow algorithms. For example, squeezing
 instructions out of the inner loop of a linear search is doomed to be less
 profitable than using a binary search in the first place.
