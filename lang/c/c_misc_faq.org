* Is =char= guaranteed a Byte

Yes, by C standard:

6.5.3.4 The sizeof operator

    1. ...
    2. The sizeof operator yields the size (in bytes) of its operand, which may be an expression or the parenthesized name of a type. [...]
    3. When applied to an operand that has type char, unsigned char, or signed char, (or a qualiÔ¨Åed version thereof) the result is 1. [...]

However, a byte of a platform is not always a octet (8 bits), mainly some DSPs.
Thus, various assumptions in C that a =char= is the same as a byte always hold.
