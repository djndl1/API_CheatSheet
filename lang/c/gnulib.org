** Character Coding Conversion

- =u8_uctomb(-aux)= (unicode to UTF-8 multibyte): encode a Unicode code point in a UTF-8 sequence.
  + the code follows the UTF-8 encoding process that first determines the
     number of bytes and then encodes in the corresponding format by working
    from the least significant digits.
    from .
  + code points not encodable by UTF-16 (surrogates, from =0xD800= to =0xDFFF=,
    which are always used in pairs) and thus Unicode are excluded.
  + the fallthrough in the switch statement somehow manages to properly prefixes
    the first byte.
