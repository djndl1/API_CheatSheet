* Include Guards and Pragma Once

#+begin_quote
neither the Unix nor the Windows filesystem API offer any mechanism that guarantees to tell you whether two absolute pathnames refer to the same file.
#+end_quote

The compiler includes a header file once as long as the two paths to the file has the same guard.
With two paths, the compiler cannot distinguish the two paths denotes the same file and thus
=pragma once= might fail.


* How to Add Internal Headers

Some headers are meant only for internal consumption. Such headers may be
protected by a custom macro. If this macro is not defined (external), a =#error=
should stop the compilation. Any internal usage of the header defines this macro.
