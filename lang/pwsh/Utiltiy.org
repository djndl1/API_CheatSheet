* =Microsoft.PowerShell.Utility=

** =Sort-Object=

Ascending/descending order, stable sort (in the original order), unique output are supported. In
addition, top/bottom n results may be listed (Pwsh 6.0). Comparison is more consistent and
easier to understand than Unix =sort= due to the OOP nature, using the
=Compare()= method, the =IComparable= interface, or the converted string
representation.

Properties may be specified as a list of property names, or a list of hash table with =Expression=
and =Descending=​/​=Ascending= properties.
