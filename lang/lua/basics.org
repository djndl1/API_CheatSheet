#+title: Basics

* Quick Started

- =lua -i prog=, =-e= for evaluation of code, =-l= load library

- =dofile("mylua.lua")=: load source file

- =_variableName= is not encouraged

* Concepts

- /Chunk/: a sequence of statements such as a file or a single line in
  interactive mode.

- Operators:
  + all binary operators in Lua are left-associative except for exponentiation
    and concatenation.

** Types

- =nil=

- =Boolean=
  + =false= and =nil= are false and anything else is true.
  + =and=, =or=, =not= work for =Boolean=, =number= and =string= and the result
    is not restricted to =Boolean=. =and= and =or= work similarly to coalescence.
  + =if not x then x = v end=
  + =((a and b) or c)= equivalent to =a ? b : c= provided that =b= is not false.

- number: =integer= (64-bit for Standard Lua and 32-bit for Small Lua) and
  =float= (double for Standard Lua and single for Small Lua)
  + =math.type(3)=, =math.type(3.0)=
  + =0x1p-1=, =0x0.2=
  + =//= floor division which rounds the quotient towards minus infinity.
  + =%= modulo always ends up with a nonnegative result.
  + number comparison is based on the operands' mathematical value.

- =string=: immutable encoding-agnostic sequence of bytes
  + =#= length()
  + =..= string concatenation: note the difference between ="10" + 1.0= and =10
    .. 1.0=
  + =tostring()=
  + ='=​-quoted ="=​-quoted
  + =[[]]= multiline strings, to handle literal =[[]]=, use ~[=[]=]~ to for
    =[[]]= within the string, also valid
    for comments.
  + =\z= for ignore any whitespace after it, useful for multiline string literal.


- =function=

- =thread=

- =table=
