* Basic Operations

- ~a~: append, ~.~: end

- ~e~: edit a file

- ~f~: show file info

- ~r~: read file into the current buffer

- ~.~: the current line

- ~;~: the current through line last lines in the buffer


- ~.,.+3p~: print the next three lines

- ~.=~: the value of dot

- ~start, end, s/change this/to this/~: ~g~ means global

- context searching ~/../~: we can do both the search for the desired line and a substitution all at once like
context searches are interchangeable with line numbers

#+begin_src
/their/s/their/the/p
#+end_src

- ~c~: change, ~i~: insert

- ~m~: move, cut and paste to


- ~g~: executes one or more commands on all the lines in the buffer that match some specified string

- ~t~: copies the addressed lines to after the specified destination address

#+begin_src
g/peling/s//pelling/gp
#end_src

- ~v~: opposite of ~g~

- ~&~: used on the right-hand part of a substitute command where it means "whatever was matched on the left-hand side"

* Basic Concept

Editing is done in two distinct modes: 

- command

- input

The general commands structure:

#+begin_src
[Address, [Addres]]Command[Paramters]
#+end_src
