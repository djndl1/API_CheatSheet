#+title: Emacs


- *keymaps*: Emacs binds keys to named commands, a special type of Lisp function.

- =C-h= to invoke help

* Editing

** Insertion

- =C-j=: newline (useful in minibuffer)

- =C-q= to insert any non-graphic characters.

- =C-x 8 RET=: inserts unicode characters.

- =C-o=: insert a blank line after (=C-x C-o=) delete blank lines.

** Point (Cursor) Navigation

- =M-g M-g=: =goto-line=

- =M-g TAB=: move to column

- To navigate a line visually, set =line-move-visual= to =t=

** Cursor location

- =line-number-mode=, =column-number-mode=, =hl-line-mode= (highlight), =display-line-mode=

- =what-line=, =C-x ==

- =count-words=, =M-== (=count-words-regioin=)

** Numeric arguments

- =digit-argument=, =negative-argument=, =universal-argument=: specifies arguments for the next command (not necessarily a repetition). To force a repetition, use =C-x z= after the command.

  To use arguments with a named command, specify the argument before running =M-x= with the command.

** Minibuffer

The area under the modeline, used also by the echo area.

*** Minibuffer Completion

=TAB=, =SPC=, =RET=, =?=, use with =M-v= (switch to the completion list)

*** Minibuffer History

- =previous-history-element=, =next-history-element=, =list-command-history=

- =C-x ESC ESC=: reexecute a recent minibuffer command

* Help

- =C-h=

- =C-h a=: searches for commands

- =C-h b=: describe bindings

- =C-h d=: search in documentation for keywords

- =C-h i=: the GNU Info manual

- =C-h f=: describe functions

- =C-h C-f= the Emacs FAQ

- =C-h p=: lists available Emacs packages

* Region, Mark

- *Mark*: the initially starting end of the selected region.

- *Mark Ring*: each buffer remembers previous locations of the mark in the *mark ring*. Setting a mark and then releasing it saves the mark in the mark ring.
  + =C-u C-SPC=: move the cursor back to the previous mark.
  + A global mark ring exists alongside the buffers' ring. =C-x C-SPC= jumps to the buffer and position of the latest entry in the global ring (saved at the same time as in a buffer's ring).

- =C-SPC=, =C-@=: set the mark at point, enter the mark mode

- =C-x C-x= (=exchange-point-and-mark=): switch between the cursor and the mark

- =SHIFT=-selection together with certain cursor motion commands: =S-M-f=

- =M-@=: move mark to the end of the next word, =C-M-@=: mark to the end of following balanced expression.

- =C-x h=: =mark-whole-buffer=; =C-x C-p= (=mark-page=)

** Operating on the Region

- =C-w=: =kill-region=, =M-w=: =kill-ring-save=.

- =M-%=: =query-replace=, query whether to replace and replace if yes.

- =C-x TAB=: indent
