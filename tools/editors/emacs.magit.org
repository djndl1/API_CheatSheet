Magit is a complete text-based user interface to Git. It fills the glaring gap
between the Git command-line interface and various GUIs, letting you perform
trivial as well as elaborate version control tasks with just a couple of
mnemonic key presses. Magit looks like a prettified version of what you get
after running a few Git commands but in Magit every bit of visible information
is also actionable to an extent that goes far beyond what any Git GUI provides
and it takes care of automatically refreshing this output when it becomes
outdated. In the background Magit just runs Git commands and if you wish you can
see what exactly is being run, making it possible for you to learn the git
command-line by using Magit.

** Basic Operations

- =C-x M-g= :: a transient page of basic operations, by default =magit-dispatch=
  + when invoked in a buffer, it's =magit-file-dispatch=

Normally, the entry is =magit-status=, which is similar to the Dired mode,
single-character key bindings are preferred.

Every section/file/hunk can be expanded/collapsed to show/hide diffs. Most
tree-like magit sections (see various =magit-section-*= commands) are like this.

If not sure, use =?= for help in a transient buffer. The magit manual is also
included as =magit-info=.

- =magit-section-forward/backword[-sibling]= :: moving around

- Pressing =ENTER= on a file/hunk/line goes to the corresponding point in the
  file.

- =magit-diff-less/more-context= :: show more/less context lines around  the hunk.

- =magit-stage= (=s=), =magit-unstage= (=u=) ::
  + if a hunk is not granular enough, mark the region and stage it.

- =magit-discard= (=k=) ::

- =magit-commit= (=c=) :: shows a popup window for commit.
  + in the =COMMIT_EDITING= buffer
    - =git-commit-prev/next-message= cycle through commit message history.
    - =C-c C-c=, =with-editor-finish= :: commits with the message in buffer.
      =C-c C-k= cancel the commit.

- =magit-log=
  + in the log buffer
    - =RET= pops open the full commit log entry at point.
    - =magit-copy-section-value= :: copies the hash value
    - =magit-reset-quickly= (=x=) :: reset the HEAD and index to a particular commit.
    - =magit-revert-no-commit=, =v= :: revert the selected commit.
    - =d= :: show the diff of the particular commit
    - =A= :: cherrypick
    - =r= :: rebase

- =magit-branch=, =b= in the status buffer
  + =magit-branch-spinoff= (switch to the new one), =magit-branch-spinout=
    (remain on the original branch) :: creates a new branch from the unpushed commits and
    set the original branch to the last commit it shares with the upstream.

- =magit-blame= :: the blame/annotate in hunks, unlike =vc-annotate=, which
  shows the default output by Git.

In case a shell git command is in need, type =!= in the status buffer.
