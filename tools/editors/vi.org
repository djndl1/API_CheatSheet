* Basic Operations

- ~ZZ~/~:wq~ 

- ~:e!~: returns to the last saved version of the file

- ~:w!~: overwrite the existing file

- ~c~: change, a combination of delete followed by insert.

- ~cc~: change the entire line

- ~C~: = ~c$~

- ~D~: delete to the end of the line = ~d$~

- ~s~: substitute a certain number of text object, i.e. delete and insert

- ~y~ (yank), ~p~ (put)

- ~.~: repeat the former command

- ~Y~: = ~yy~

- ~ra~: replace the current char with ~a~

- ~R~: replace mode, overstrike the current line

- =~=: changing case

- ~xp~: transpose the current and the next character

- ~A~/~I~: append to the end/begging of the line

- ~J~: join

- ~-~/~+~: to the first char of the previous/next line

- ~^f~/~^b~: scroll up/down a screen

- ~^d~/~^u~: scroll up/down half screen

- ~^e~/~^y~: scroll up/down one line

- ~zENTER~/~z.~/~z-~: move current line to top/center/bottom of screen and scroll

- ~H~/~M~/~L~: move home/middle/last line on screen

- ~n|~: move to column n

- ~(~/~)~, ~{~/~}~, ~[[~/~]]~: move to beginning of current/next sentence/paragraph/section

- Commands that change text can be combined with ~/~ and ~?~

- ~f~/~F~/~t~/~T~/~;~/~,~

- ~G~/~``~: go to/back

* Advanced Operations

~y~/~d~ can be used with a-z named buffers that are specifically available for copying and moving text. A-Z appends text to these buffers.

#+begin_src
"dyy
"a7yy

"dP
"ap
#+end_src

- ~mx~/~'x~/~`x~/~``~

* Basic Concepts

~vi~ has tow modes:

- command mode:

- insert mode:

The general form of ~vi~ commands is 

#+begin_src 
(command)(number)(text object)
(number)(command)(text object)
#+end_src

=vi= saves the last nine deleted line in nine numbered deletion buffers.

* ex commands

A command without a line number is assumed to affect the current line.

- ~co~: copy lines

- ~g!~/~v~: the opposite of ~g~

- ~|~: command separator

- ~;~: the first line address isrecalculated as the current line

Line addressing can be used to save part of a file.

~>>~ can also be used in ex mode to append to a file.

- ~#~: alternative buffer, ~%~: current file 

- ~Ctrl-^~: switching between buffers
