* Execute Shell Commands and Display the Results in the Buffer

:END:

Use =shell-command= and =shell-command-on-region= with or without prefix
argument (in the current buffer). Note that =shell-command-on-region= reads the
region into the standard input, not the region as the command to execute.

Use =+eval/= commands when using Doom Emacs with =sh-mode= (Shell Script mode).
