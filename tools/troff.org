#+title: Troff (Typesetter roff)

Pronounced tee-roff.

A typesetting system from the original UNIX, which is originally intended for
use with typesetters. Various macro packages exist for various document styles.

=groff= is the GNU implementation of troff, with a large number of helper
programs, preprocessors and postprocessors. Another modern program commonly used
for man pages is =mandoc=, which focuses on man pages only, not general typesetting.
