Unlike LaTeX, TeX requires does not requires an outline. It only requires a
=\bye= to mark the end of the document.

** Control Sequences

Some characters have special purposes:  =^=, =_=, =%=, =~=, =#=, =&=, which must
be prefixed with =\= when used literally.

- =\= :: starts a control sequence, e.g. =\alpha=, =\it=

- ={=, =}= :: for grouping, everything in between is regarded as a single unit.

- =$= :: math mode

** Normal Document

- Paragraphs are separated by a blank line.

- Normal EOLs are treated as blank spaces. Multiple blank spaces are collapsed
  into one. Blank spaces at the beginning of end of a line are trimmed. Use =\ =
  or even =\hskip=
  to force a blank space.

- Double quotes are represented by two
  single quotes. The ="= and ='= quotes should not be used since TeX has no
  knowledge of its direction (use =\lq= and =\rq=).

- =\beginsection= followed by a section title produces a section heading.

- font markup: =\rm=, =\sl=, =\it=, =\tt=, =\bf= set the global font. Use ={}=
  to set the local font.

- Accents can be produced with control sequences. (nowadays probably with Unicode).

** Mathematics Mode

Most control sequences are similar to those in LaTeX.

- =$= for inline math and =$$= for displayed math

- Use =\eqno= and =\leqno= to number equations
