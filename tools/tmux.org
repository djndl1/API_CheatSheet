#+title: Tmux

#+begin_quote
tmux is to the console what a desktop is to GUI apps.
#+end_quote

tmux runs a server in the background, maintaining all the sessions. Multiple
uses can attach to the same session (great for pair programming).

- Hierarchy : *Server* (X) - *Session* (Virtual desktop) - *Window* (Tiling GUI
  windows) - *Pane* (subwindow regions)

* Usage

Tmux is controlled by sending various commands to it. Commands are can be sent
using keyboard sequences, prefixed by a certain key, or =tmux command=, or in
the prompt after =Prefix := inside tmux.

- prefix key: the default is =C-b=

- Send the prefix key twice to control a nested session or =send-prefix=

Configuration files are command scripts. tmux command are also input via
=Prefix= + =:=.

- =list-keys= to show all keybindings.

* Clipboard

tmux has a clipboard to copy/paste across sessions, windows and panes.

- =Prefix-[= to enter copy mode

- =Prefix-]= to paste and =Alt-W= to copy.

Copy mode does not work with Vim and Emacs.

* Hierarchy

- *Server*: connected to via a socket
  + a server may contain one or more sessions.
  + =tmux -L socket_name=: creates a new server
  + =tmux -L socket_name attach=: attach to that server
  + =list-clients=

- *Session*:
  + =tmux [new-session [-s session_name]]= creates a new session
  + =Prefix-d=: detach from the session.
  + =Prefix-(= (previous session) or =Prefix-)= (next session), =Prefix-L= (the last
    session), =Prefix-s= (session!) (interactively select a session): these commands are
    actually use =switch-client -t=.
  + A session has a name: =rename-session=
  + =tmux has-session -t session_name= to test a session

- *Window*:
  + =base-index=: by default a window starts at 0.
  + =Prefix-c=: create a new window
  + =Prefix-x=: kill a window with all its panes.
  + =Prefix-p= =previous-window=, =Prefix-n= =next-window=, =Prefix-1,2,3,4=,
    =Prefix-I=. =Prefix-w= (window!) =choose-window= (interactively) switch windows.
  + =Prefix-.=: =move-window= to reorder windows
  + A window has a name: =rename-window= or =Prefix-,=
  + =kill-window= to quit a window; =Prefix-&= kill the current window

- *Pane*: pseudoterminals encapsulating shells.
  + =split-window -v/-h=, =Prefix-%/"=
  + =Prefix-;=, =Prefix-Up/Down/Left/Right=: move between panes
  + =Prefix-o=: select the next pane (similar to Emacs);
  + =Prefix-z= zoom in/out a pane.
  + =resize-pane=; =Prefix-Ctrl-ArrowKey=
  + there are several predefined pane layout: =even-horizontal=,
    =even-vertical=, =main-horizontal=, =main-vertical=, =tiled=, use
    =select-layout= to choose one
  + =pipe-pane -o= output a pane to a file
