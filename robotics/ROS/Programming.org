* Custom msg and srv

Message definitions in the =.msg= file will be converted into equivalent 
C++ codes.

For =msg=, 
Need to modify =add_message_files=, =generate_message=,
add =message_generation= in =find_package= in CMake and 
add =<build_depend>message_generation</build_depend>= and 
=<exec_depend>message_runtime</exec_depend>= in the manifest.

For srv, =add_service_files=;
create a service callback and publish it.

* Actionlib

Preempt the running request and start sending another one if the request is not 
finished on time as expected.

Action specifications =.action= have to be made and kept inside =action= folder.
The action file defines:

#+BEGIN_SRC 
#goal definition 
int32 count 
--- 
#result definition 
int32 final_count 
--- 
#feedback 
int32 current_number 
#+END_SRC
