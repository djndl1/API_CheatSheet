 ROS has a standard meta package for designing and creating robot models called
=robot_model=.

- =urdf=: Unified Robot Description Format, an XML file representing a robot model
  A robot model, sensors and a working environment can be defin ed using URDF, and 
  parsed using URDF parsers. The robot will have rigid links and will be connected
  using joints. Flexible links can't be represented using URDF.

URDF can represent the kinematic and dynamic description of the robot, the 
visual representation of the robot and the collision model of the robot.

- =link= tag: a single link of a robot, including the size, shape, the color and
  it even imports a 3D mesh to represe t the robot link.

- =joint=: represents a robot joint.  the movement and its velocity.
