# Some Issues About `ccls`

I'm not going to repeat how you should build `ccls` and configure inside emacs. The github page has already clearly explains it. The main issue is that, even if you have successfully built it and configured it all correctly, you won't be able to use it out of the box. Project setup can be frustrating if you are not prepared for it. Yes, the github page has stated everything that you should do. Do it but it won't be enough. 

I assume you are using `lsp-mode`. After opening a project, where there might a `compile_commands.json` or a `.ccls`, `ccls` will start to parse and index as required. However, here's what you'll see in emacs: you might see lots of warnings: `LSP :: not indexed` popping out, headers not found, symbols not declared etc. Make sure all indexing has been completed when you open a file in that project. If it is the first time that you import the project using `lsp-mode`, after completing indexing, close emacs. Open it again and open any file that might be indexed in that project. Still, many warnings and errors are there. Wait for a few seconds for the cache to be loaded, kill the buffer just opened and reopen it. Everything should be fine then; semantic highlighting should be displayed; all includes should have been underlined.
