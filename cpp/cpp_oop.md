# Classes

In C++ `struct` find little use, they are mainly used to aggregate data within the context of classes or t odefine elaborate return values. C++ extends the C `struct` and `union` concepts by allowing the definition of member functions within these data types.

Use `const` reference to return a private member to prevent backdoor, that is, modifying objects without going through a mutator.

The global object is constructed first, then first objects in the `main` function, finally those in other functions.
