* Problem Formulation

object detection: Locating objects in an image

/sliding window/, the brute-force way: go over the whole image with different sized rectangles 
  and get a giant number of small images to look at.

* Region Proposals: Smartly Choosing Small Images

- [[https://www.learnopencv.com/selective-search-for-object-detection-cpp-python/][selective search]] is used to generate region proposals.

- The R-CNN is agnostic to the region proposal method.

* CNN

- AlexNet is used as a feature extractor. 

- The AlexNet was trained before on a classification task.

- The last softmax layer was removed after training. 

- Region proposals are resized before feeding into the AlexNet.

* SVM as the Classifier

- One SVM for each object class. For one feature vector input there is $n$ output confidence score
  , where $n$ is the number of different objects.

- SVMs are trained on feature vectors created by the AlexNet, which means the SVMs are trained after
  the CNN.

* Rejecting a proposal

[[][greedy non-maximum suppression]]: reject a region if it has an IOU overlap with a higher scoring 
selected region. This step is done for each object class independently. After this, only regions with
score higher than $0.5$ is used.

* Bounding Box Regressor (not a fundamental building block)
