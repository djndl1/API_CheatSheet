* Background

The Inception models share a common property: split-transform-merge strategy

The realization of Inception models has been accompanied with a series of complicating factors, the filter numbers and sizes 
are tailored for each individual transformation, and the modules are customized stage by stage

* Method

** Template

- A stack of residual blocks with the same topology

- If producing spatial maps of the same size ,the blocks share the same hyperparameters (width and filter sizes)

- each time when the spatial map is downsampled by a factor of 2, the width of the blocks is multiplied by a factor of 2

** Splitting - Transforming - aggregating

The aggregation can be defined as 

$$
F\left(\mathbf{x}\right)=\sum_{i=1}^{C}T_{i}\left(\mathbf{x}\right)
$$

where $C$ is called /cardinality/, which is an essential dimension and can be moreeffective than the dimensions of width and depth.

with shortcut connection, this becomes

$$
F\left(\mathbf{x}\right)= x + \sum_{i=1}^{C}T_{i}\left(\mathbf{x}\right)
$$

- block type 1: [256-d in, (1, 1), 128 filters] -> [(3, 3) 128 filters, group = 32] -> [128, (1, 1), 256]

* Implementation Details

- the shortcuts are identity connections except for those increasing dimensions which are projections

- Downsampling is done by stride-2 convolutions in the (3, 3) layer of the first block in each stage

- SGD: lr = 0.1, divided by 10 for three times, momentum 0.9; weight decay 0.0001
