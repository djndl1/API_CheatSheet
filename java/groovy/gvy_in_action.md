# Intro

Groovy is an optionally typed, dynamic language for the Java platform. It can be precompiled into Java bytecode, integrated into Java applications, power web applications, add an extra degree of control within build files and be the basis of whole applications on its own.

Groovy is Java-friendly. Every Groovy type is a subtype of `java.lang.Object`. Every Groovy object is an instance of a type in the normal way. Groovy fully stays inside the Java object model. You're free to choose Java or Groovy when implementing any class. Groovy has syntax alignment with Java.

Groovy has three main enhancements  and above those of Java:

- language features

- libraries specific to Groovy

- additions to the existing Java standard calsses (Groovy Development Kit)
