# OOP design

An object is a collection of dat and associated behaviors.

- OO analysis -> identifies the objects and interactions between those objects;

- OO design -> converting the resulting requirements of OOA into an implementation specification.

- OO programming -> converting the design into a working program.

Most twenty-first century development happens in an iterative development model. In iterative development, a small part of the task is modeled, designed, and programmed, then the program is reviewed and expanded to improve each feature and include new features in a series of short development cycles.

Objects: attributes, behaviors

Objects are an abstraction of a real concept. Abstraction means dealing with the level of detail that is most appropriate to a given task. Abstrction is the process of encapsulating information with separate public and private interfaces.
