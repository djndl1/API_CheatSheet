The core directive in competitive programming is to solve well-known CS problems as quickly as possible. The true end goal of competitive programming is to produce all-rounder computer scientists/programmers who are much readier to produce better software and to face harder CS research problems in the future.

- Type Code Faster

- Quickly Identify Problem Types

- Do Algorithm Analysis: pick the simplest solution that works. By analyzing the complexity of the algorithm with the given input bound and the stated time/memory limit, one can better decide whether to attempt to implement the algorithm, attempt to improve the algorithm first, or switch to other problems. Refrain from coding until you are sure that the algorithm is both correct and fast enough.

- Languages: C++ with its built-in STL. Java has powerful built-in libraries and APIs. Mastering and understanding the full capacity of a programming language is important.

- Master the art of testing code: design good, comprehensive and tricky test cases. Use `diff` to check the code's output against the sample output. Include tricky corner cases. Increase the input size incrementally up to the maximum input bounds stated in the problem descriptor.
