#+title: Guide To Competitive Programming

Competitive programming combines algorithm design with algorithm implementation.

* Resources

- Online Contests: Codeforces, AtCoder, CodeChef, CS Academy, HackerRank,
  Topcode,

- CSES Problem Set: a collection of problems in the order of difficulty.

* Some Techniques

In case some integers are too large to work with modular arithmetic, use the
following equations.

$$
(a + b) mod m = (a mod m + b mod m) mod m
(a − b) mod m = (a mod m − b mod m) mod m
(a · b) mod m = (a mod m · b mod m) mod m
$$

To obtain non-negative remainder

#+begin_src cpp
r = x % m;
if (r < 0) r += m; // one division, one subtraction and possibly one more addition
// or
r = ((x % m) + m) % m; // two divisions and one addition
#+end_src
