# Intro

Computer network means a collection of autonomous computers interconnected by a single technology. A distributed system i a collection of independent computers appears to its uers as a single coherent system.

## Use

resource sharing, VPNs, server-client model, VoIP, desktop sharing, publishing, P2P, instant messaging, social network, wiki, IPTV, e-commerce, ubiquitous computing, powerline networks, RFID, NFC, sensor networks.

## Social Issues

network neutrality, DMCA, censorship, profiling, phishing, CAPTACHA, botnet

# Network Hardware

There are two types of transmission technology that are in widespread use:

- broadcast links: the communication channel is shared by all the machines on the network; packets sent by any machine are received by all the others. e.g. wireless network

- point-to-point links: connects individual pairs of machines

By scale

- Person Area Networks (PAN): e.g. a wireless network 
that conenct a computer with its peripherals; bluebooth

- Local Area Networks (LAN): privately owned network that operates within and nearby a single building like a home, office or factory. It is possible to divide one large physical LAN into smaller logical LANs. Both wireless and wired broadcast networks can be divided into static and dynamic designs, depending on how the channel is allocated. e.g. enterprise networks, Wifi, Ethernet (in a switched Ethernet, each computer speaks the the Ethernet protocol and connects to a switch with a point-to-point link).

- Metropolitan Area Networks (MAN): A MAN covers a city. e.g. cable television, IEEE 802.16 (WiMAX).

- Wide Area Network: spans a large geograpical area, often a country or continent. The term _subnet_ was originally the collection of routers and communication lines that moved packets from the source host to the destination host. A WAN can be dedicated one or a VPN, or an ISP network. Other examples include satellite networks, cellular telephone networks.

- Internetworks/internet: many networks exist in the world, often with different hardware and software. The internet uses ISP networks to connect enterprise networks, home networks, and many other networks. A network is formed by the combination of a subnet and its hosts. The general name for a machine that makes a connection between two or more networks and provide the necessary translation, both in terms of hardware and software, is a _gateway_. Gateways are distinguished by the layer at which they operate in the protocol hierarchy.
