#+title: Structure and Interpretation of Computer Programs

#+begin_quote
Every computer program is a model, hatched in the
mind, of a real or mental process. These processes, arising from human
experience and thought, are huge in number, intricate in detail, and at
any time only partially understood.

as programs get large and complicated, as they almost always do, the
adequacy, consistency, and correctness of the specifications themselves
become open to doubt, so that complete formal arguments of correctness
seldom accompany large programs. Since large programs grow from
small ones, it is crucial that we develop an arsenal of standard program
structures of whose correctness we have become sure-we call them
idioms-and learn to combine them into larger structures
using organizational techniques of proven value.
