#+title: Modbus_basics


A de factor standard protocol and a commonly available means of connecting
industrial electronic devices.

* Transport

- Character serial communication lines
  + /Modbus RTU/: compact binary representation. Framed by silent periods. uses
    CRC checksums. Only one device can act as the client.
  + /Modbus ASCII/: use ASCII characters for communication.

- IP suite: any device cna send out a Modbus command.
  + Modbus TCP/IP: communication over TCP/IP 502 port; no checksum
  + Modbus over TCP/IP: checksummed variant

* Limitations

- Large binary objects are not supported.

- no metadata about a data object.

- no event mechanism except open-mbus. The client must poll each field device
  and look for changes in the data.

- Restricted to addressing 247 devices on one data link (except for Ethernet
  TCP/IP).

- no security mechanism.

* Object Types

- /Coil/ (1-bit RW)

- /Discrete input/ (1-bit RO)

- /Input Register/ (16-bit RO)

- /Holding Register/ (16-bit RW)

* Command

A Modbus command reads or writes to a data object on a device.

* Format

- ADU = Address + PDU + Error check
  + PDU = Function code + Data
