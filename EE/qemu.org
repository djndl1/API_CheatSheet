ARM virt machine requires a firmware to start.

* Networking

** Bridging

The VM part is relatively easy: set the bridge device name.
Network manager can create a bridge, but the GUI does not bring up the slave
(the bridging target). =nmcli= is required to bring up the slave. Also, a bridge
cannot be bound to a WiFi device.

#+begin_src sh
nmcli conn up bridge-conn
nmcli conn up bridge-slave-conn
#+end_src
