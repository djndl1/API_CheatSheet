* Semiconductor

#+begin_quote
A solid substance can conduct electric current only if it contains charged particles, electrons, which are free to move about and not attached to atoms.
#+end_quote

The conductivity of semiconductors can be greatly improved by replacing or adding certain donor or acceptor atoms (/doping/) to this crystalline structure thereby, producing more free electrons than holes or vice versa.

** Extrinsic Semiconductor

Doped with /doping agent/ to purposely give it different electrical properties than
intrinsic semiconductor.

*** N-Type Semiconductor

Antimony/Phosphorus as /donor/ atoms, with an excess of current-carrying
electrons. Positive-charged nuclei cannot move freely due to chemical bonds,
while the free electrons move around.

*** P-Type Semiconductor

Aluminium, Boron or Indium (which have only three valence electrons in their outermost orbital) as /acceptor/ atoms. The four closed bond cannot be formed,
leaving a hole for free electrons to fill in. The filled atoms are negatively charged, leaving free positively charged "holes".

*** PN Junction

Indivually, these two types are both valid materials that can conduct current, not much different from a normal useful conductor. However, when joined together, a large density gradient exists between bothe sides of the /PN junction/: free electrons from the N-type side move to the P-side to fill up the holes there,
leaving the N-type positively charged. This /diffusion/ causes both sides lose electrical neutrality. This process goes on to a equilibrium where the formed voltage prevents any more free electrons from crossing the junction.
This newly-formed layer (/The Deletion Layer/) is now depleted of any moer free
charge carriers.

Since the N-type has mainly free electrons, but maintains high potential, preventing carriers from easily crossing the junction. This /potential barrier/ opposes both the flow of holes and electrons across the junction.

* Diode

With both sides of a PN junction attached with electrical contacts, a /PN Junction diode/ is made.

** PN Junction Diode

*** With Zero External Voltage (Zero Bias)

The potential barrier discourages the diffusion of majority carriers but helps minority carriers to drift across the junction.

- /Forward Current/ $I_{F}$: a few holes in P-type side with enough energy move across the junction

- /Reverse Current/ $I_{R}$: Since the N-type side has higher potential, the holes there move across the junction.

This will at last result in a "Dynamic equilibrium".

*** With Reverse Biase (External Voltage from N to P)

The external voltage attracts majority carriers to the electrodes, widening the
depletion layer.

- /Reverse leakage current/: a small current that flows through the junction in $\mu A$

A reverse bias high enough will overheat and break the diode, causing the diode
to become shorted.

*** With Forward Bias (External Voltage from P to N)

The external voltage encourage majority carriers to cross the junction.

- /knee/: the point where the potential barrier is overcome by the external voltage

After the knee, the diode basically becomes shorted.

** Signal Diode

Small diodes generally used in electronic circuits.

- Point Contact Diode

- Glass Passivated Diode

*** Parameters

- Maximum Forward Current $I_{F\(max\)}$

- Peak Inverse Voltage $V_{R\(max\)}$: the maximum allowable reverse operating
  voltage that can be applied across the diode without reverse breakdown and damage. Usually less than the avalanche breakdown level.

- Total Power Dissipation $P_{D\(max)\)}$: maximum possible power dissipation of the diode when it is forward biased

- Maximum Operating Temperature: relates to the Junction Temperature

*** Signal Diodes In Practice

- Signal diode arrays: switching or clamping in digital circuits to protect against eletrostatic discharge (ESD) and voltage transients.

- Signal diodes in series: provide a constant DC voltage across the diode combination.

- Freewheel diodes: a diode connected in parallel witha coid or inductive load to prevent damage to the delicate switching circuit by suppressing the voltage spikes or transient that are generated when the load is suddenly turned off.
  + when the coil is turned on, the diode is reversely biased, when the coil is
    suddenly turned off, the inductive current flows forward through the coil.
