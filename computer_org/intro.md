# Eight Ideas

- Design for Moore's law. Computer architects must anticipate where the technology will be when the design finishes rather than design for where it starts.

- Use abstraction to simplify design: e.g. hardware- system software - application software; low-level language - high-level language

- Making the common case fast will tend to enhance the performance better than optimizing the rare case.

- performance via parallelism

- performance via pipelining

- performance via prediction: in some cases, it can be faster on average to guests and start working rather than wait until you know for sure.

- hierarchy of memories

- dependability via redundancy

# Organization

- I/O

- memory: main/primary memory, secondary memory

- datapath: the component that performs arithmetic operations

- control: commands the datapath, memory and I/O devices according to the instructions of the program.
