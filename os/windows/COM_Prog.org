** Why And A lot of other buzzwords

COM evolved out of the solution to a specific problem â€” how to allow a
word processor to edit the spread sheet in a letter without the user having to
exit the word processor to do it. This solution was called OLE (Object Linking and Embedding)
and contained a very sophisticated API that allows you
even today to edit a letter within Internet Explorer using Microsoft Word.
With the second release of OLE (OLE2), its creators modified
OLE32.DLL to expose more of the basic functionality of OLE so that its API
could be used to allow any application to access the functionality of
another.
