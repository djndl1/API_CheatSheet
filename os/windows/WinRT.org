* What is WinRT Anyway

- Not a runtime (a collection of helper libraries that provide support for a platform or a language).

- An ABI: a set of binary-level common protocols that describe how components
  can talk to each other.
  + WinRT API: a set of OOP API that expose OS functionality.
  + A set of compilers/langauges that understands the ABI, with WinMD to store the metadata of the ABI/API.
  + 3rd party libraries and controls.

- Strongly-Typed COM: =IInspectable= can be inspected to expose type info and identity.

** WinRT over COM

- =IInspectable= over =IUnknown= for better type info.

- A common metadata format: WinMD

- A common set of collection interfaces.

- Supports object inheritance.

- Passing arbitrary value type as objects.

- New way to hook up events using delegates.

- Ability to resolve ref cycles using .NET GC.

- Data binding through reflection or reflection-like mechanism.
