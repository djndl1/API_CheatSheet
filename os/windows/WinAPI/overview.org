#+title: Overview

On Windows, many systme resources are represented as a *kernel object*
identified and referenced by a *handle* and manipulated by Windows API,
including files, processes, threads, pipes for interprocess communication,
memory mapping, events and many more. Objects have *security attributes*.

Windows API function names tend to be long and descriptive. A few predefined
data types (=BOOL=, =HANDLE=, =DWORD=, =LPTSTR=, =LPSECURITY_ATTRIBUTES=) are
specific to Windows, although many feel anachronism and many are obsolet but
never removed. =windows.h= is always necesary and contains all Windows function definitions and
data types.
