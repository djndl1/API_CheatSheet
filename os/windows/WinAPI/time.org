** =FILETIME= timestamp

=FILETIME= is the timestamp used by Windows (Do not be fooled by the name). It
represents the number of 100-nanosecond ticks since 1601-01-01T00:00:00Z,
supposedly a UTC time. The tick number is supposed to be nonnegative, with the
highest bit unused, and its value ranging from year 1601
through year 30827.

#+begin_src c
typedef struct _FILETIME {
  DWORD dwLowDateTime;
  DWORD dwHighDateTime; // the
} FILETIME, *PFILETIME, *LPFILETIME;
#+end_src

For any integer operation on =FILETIME=, cast it to the =ULARGE_INTEGER= union
and use =QuadPart=. Do not cast a =FILETIME= pointer to access it, which causes
alignment faults on Win64.
