# Signals

Signals are software interrupts. Signals provide a way of handling asynchronous events.

Read `man 7 signal`.

## Concepts

Every signal has a name beginning with `SIG`. Signal names are defined by positive integer constants. Terminal, hardware exceptions, `kill` function, `kill` command or software conditions can generate signals.

We can tell the kernel to set the _disposition_ of the signal.

- ignore the signal: `SIGKILL` and `SIGSTOP` cannot be ignored

- catch the signal: call a function when the signal occurs

- let the default action apply: every signal has a default action.

## `signal()`

The semantics of `signal` differ among implementations, we must use `sigaction` instead.

When a program is executed, the status of all signal is either default or ignore. Normally, all signals are set to their default action unless the processthat calls `exec` is ignoring the signal. When a process calls `fork`, the child inherits the parent's signal dispositions.

## Reentrant Functions

The SUS specifies the functions that are guaranteed to be safe to call from within a signal handler. These functions are reentrant and are called _async-signal safe_. They block any signals during operation if delivery of a signal might causes inconsistencies.

As a general rule, when calling the reentrant async-signal safe functions from a signal handler, we should save and restore `errno`.

## Reliable Signal 

A signal is _generated_ for a process (or sent to a process) when the event that causes the signal occurs. It is _delivered_ to a process when the action for a signal is taken. Between signal generation and delivery, the signal is said to be _pending_. A process has the option of _blocking_ the delivery of a signal. If a blocked signal's action is not ignore, it's pending until the process either unblocks the signal or changes the action to ignore the signal. `sigpending` determines which signals are blocked and pending. If the system delivers the signal more than once, the signals are said to be queued.

Each process has _signal mask_ that defines the set of signals currently blocked from delivery to that process.

## Sending a Signal

`kill()` sends a signal to a process or a group of processes. `raise` allows a process to send a signal to itself. `alarm` sets a timer and generates a `SIGALRM` after the timeout. The default disposition is to terminate the program. Most processes that use an alarm clock catch this signal. `pause` suspends the calling process until a signal is caught.

```c

#include <setjmp.h>
#include <signal.h>
#include <unistd.h>

static jmp_buf env_alrm;

static void sig_alrm(int signo)
{
        longjmp(env_alrm, 1);
}

unsigned int sleep2(unsigned int seconds)
{
        if (signal(SIGALRM, sig_alrm) == SIG_ERR)
                return seconds;
        if (setjmp(env_alrm) == 0) {
                alarm(seconds);
                pause();
        }

        return alarm(0);
}
// this implementation of sleep will interrupt other signal handlers
```

A common use for `alarm` is to put an upper time limit on operations that can block.

```c 
#include <stdio.h>
#include <setjmp.h>
#include <signal.h>
#include <unistd.h>

#define MAXLINE 4096

static jmp_buf env_alrm;

static void sig_alrm()
{
        longjmp(env_alrm, 1);
}

int main(int argc, char *argv[])
{
        int     n;
        char    line[MAXLINE];

        if (signal(SIGALRM, sig_alrm) == SIG_ERR)
                fprintf(stderr, "signal(SIGALRM) error");
        if (setjmp(env_alrm) != 0) {
                fprintf(stderr, "read timeout");
                return 1;
        }

        alarm(10);
        if ((n = read(STDIN_FILENO, line, MAXLINE)) < 0) {
                fprintf(stdout, "read error");
                return 2;
        }
        alarm(0);

        write(STDOUT_FILENO, line, n);
        return 0;
}
```

## Signal Sets

Signals can be grouped into a set `sigset_t` so that the kernel can mask a group of them.

```c
       int sigemptyset(sigset_t *set);

       int sigfillset(sigset_t *set);

       int sigaddset(sigset_t *set, int signum);

       int sigdelset(sigset_t *set, int signum);

       int sigismember(const sigset_t *set, int signum);
```

A process can examine its signal mask, change its signal mask, or perform both operations in one step by calling `sigprocmask()`. `sigpending` returns the set of signals that are blocked from delivery and currently pending for the calling process. We can use signal mask to protect critical regions of code that we don't want interrupted by a signal.

## `sigaction`

`sigaction` supersedes `signal` and what's more:

```c
void (*signal(int sig, void (*func)(int)))(int)
{
	struct sigaction sa_old, sa = { .sa_handler = func, .sa_flags = SA_RESTART };
	if (__sigaction(sig, &sa, &sa_old) < 0)
		return SIG_ERR;
	return sa_old.sa_handler;
}
```

## `sigsetjmp` and `siglongjmp`

When a signal is caught, the signal-catching function is entered, with the current signal automatically being added to the signal mask of the process. To allow to choose non-local goto save and restore signal mask, POSIX defines `sigsetjmp` and `siglongjmp`. They should always be used when branching from a signal handler.

```c
       int sigsetjmp(sigjmp_buf env, int savesigs);
       void siglongjmp(sigjmp_buf env, int val);
```

## `sigsuspend`

After we unblock a few signals, the pending signals  may immediately be delivered. `sigsuspend()` restores  the signal mask and put the process to sleep in a single atomic operation. The process is suspended until a signal is caught or until a signal occurs that terminates the process. If a signal is caught and if the signal handler returns, then `sigsuspend` returns, and the signal mask of the process is set to its value before the call to `sigsuspend`.

TODO 

## `abort`

`abort()` sends the `SGIABRT` to the caller. The intent of letting the process catch the `SIGABRT` is to allow it to perform any cleanup that it wants to do before the process terminates.  If the process doesnâ€™t terminate itself from this signal handler, POSIX.1 states that, when the signal handler returns, abort terminates the process.

Catching the signal is intended to provide the application developer with a portable means  to abort processing, free from possible interference from any implementation-supplied functions.

```c
#include <signal.h>
#include <stdio.h>
#include <stdlib.h>
#include <unistd.h>

void my_abort(void)
{
        sigset_t            mask;
        struct sigaction    action;

        // restore SIGABRT disposition
        sigaction(SIGABRT, NULL, &action);
        if (action.sa_handler == SIG_IGN) {
                action.sa_handler = SIG_DFL;
                sigaction(SIGABRT, &action, NULL);
        }
        if (action.sa_handler == SIG_DFL)
                fflush(NULL);           // flush all open stdio streams

        // ensure that SIGABRT is not ignored
        sigfillset(&mask);
        sigdelset(&mask, SIGABRT);
        sigprocmask(SIG_SETMASK, &mask, NULL);
        kill(getpid(), SIGABRT); // may not be default action

        fflush(NULL);           // the signal handler may generate some output
        action.sa_handler = SIG_DFL;
        sigaction(SIGABRT, &action, NULL);
        sigprocmask(SIG_SETMASK, &mask, NULL); // just in case
        kill(getpid(), SIGABRT);               // one more time
        exit(1);
}
```
