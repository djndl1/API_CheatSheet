* Common Special Characters

=stty -a= shows the current setting of key mappings to special characters.

- =^H= :: originally the BS (backspace) command on a teletypewriter, later used the
  Unix =erase= special character to erase the previous character. A =BACKSPACE= key is also
  mapped to =^H= to generate the an =erase= character. On some systems, =^?= is
  also mapped to =erase= or a second =erase2=.

- =^M= (=CR=, the =ENTER= key), =^J= (=LF=) :: Newlines are saved as =LF=. The system
  converts =^M= (=CR=) into =^J= (=LF=) with terminal input while with terminal output =LF=​s are converted to =CRLF=​s.

- =quit= :: historically it stops a program and generates a core dump. No longer
  in actual use.

- =eof=, typically mapped to =^D=, ASCII =EOT= :: end-of-file. Programs tend to
  quit or start to process input data upon receiving =EOF=.

* Terminal Incompatibility
:PROPERTIES:
:ID:       a7ed193a-fa86-49e2-9778-3f8e5658bae1
:END:

Character sequences for terminal operations are not standardized on different
terminals. Software requires a standarized way to access terminal features, and
thus =termcap=, =terminfo=, =curses= are created.

         Input Device
#+end_src

A terminal device (native or pseudo) has an associated terminal driver
that handles input and output on the device that works in two modes:

- /Canonical mode/: line-oriented, where =read()= reads at most one line.

- /Noncanonical mode/: the app is able to read single characters without the
  user needing to press =Enter=.

The terminal driver also handles special characters such as the interrupt
character or the end-of-file character and possibly generates a signal
for the foreground process group.

The terminal driver maintains two queues, one for input and the other for
output. The driver may automatically appends a copy of any input character to
the output queue to echo. The kernel handles the output flow control in itself.

* Terminal Configuration
:PROPERTIES:
:ID:       9ec05ffd-50db-4e1d-abe5-2d4f0b8291a4
:END:

** Programmatic

#+begin_src c
       int tcgetattr(int fd, struct termios *termios_p);

       int tcsetattr(int fd, int optional_actions,
                     const struct termios *termios_p);
#+end_src

These two functions are the programmatic way to configure various aspects
and behaviors of a terminal.

The user is supposed to retrieve the attributes and modify it with =tcsetattr=
and then retrieve again to check and ensure all modifications are applied.

** Command Line =stty=

A util program that calls =tcgetattr= and =tcsetattr=.

To restore the terminal to a sane configuration, use =Ctrl-J stty sane Ctrl-J=
in case some other program has changed the terminal but fails to restore it.
