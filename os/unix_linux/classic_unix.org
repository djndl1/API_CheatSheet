#+title: Classic Unix
#+bibliography: unix.bib

Mostly based on the 7th Edition of Unix, System V and 4.1BSD, when UNIX has
already matured.

#+begin_quote
Many UNIX programs do quite trivial tasks in isolation, but combined with other
programs, become general and useful tools.
#+end_quote

UNIX is a time-sharing operating system kernel: a program that controls the
resources of a computer and allocated them among its users.

* Terminal

Every character typed into the terminal is sent to the computer and echoed back
on the terminal unless some secret passwords are typed.

#+begin_quote
Tab stops on UNIX systems are eight spaces apart.
#+end_quote

- =mail= reads and sends emails.

- =write= immediately establishes two-way communication with users on other terminals.
