The LFS only build three compilers:
- one that runs on the host and targets the LFS =pc-pc-lfs=
  + first pass: binutils, gcc, kernel API headers, glibc, libstdc++ without exception support
- one that is cross-compiled and runs on the LFS and targets the LFS. =pc-lfs-lfs=
  + a basic linux environment and gcc is built using the toolchain of the first pass
- one that is native-compiled on the LFS, runs on the LFS and targets the LFS. =lfs-lfs-lfs=
