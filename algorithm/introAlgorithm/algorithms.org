* Introduction

** Peak Finding (1D Version)

- Formulation: Suppose there is an array of integers. The problem is to find a peak 
(the numbers that are larger than or equal to their neighbors).

#+INCLUDE: "python-implementation/peak_finder_1d.py" src python

- ~naive_peak_finder_1d~: $\Theta(n)$ 

- ~recursive_peak_finder_1d~: $Theta(\log_{2) n$

** Peak Finding (2D Version)

- Formulation: $a$ is a 2D-peak 
iff $a$ is greater than or equal to all its neighbors (the four cells around it).

#+INCLUDE: "python-implementation/peak_finder_2d.py" src python

- ~greedy_ascent_peak_finder~: worst case $\Theta(nm)$

** Reading Notes

*instance of the problem*: the input that satisfies the constraints of the problem

*data structure*: a way to store and organize data in order to facilitate access and modifications.

Algorithims considered as a technology, total system performance depends on choosing efficient algorithms as much as on choosing fast hardware. 
Algorithims are at the core of most technologies used in contemporary computers.
