# Data  Structures

One of the basic rules concerning programming is that no routine should ever exceed a page.

An _abstract data type_ (ADT) is a set of operations. Abstract data types are mathematical abstractions. Objects such as lists, sets, and graphs along with their operations, can be viewed as abstract data types, just as integers, reals, and booleans are data types. There is no rule telling us which operations msut be supported for each ADT; this is a design decision.

## Lists, Stacks, Queues

### List
A general list of the form $A_1, A_2, A_3, \dots, A_N$. A special list of size 0 is an _empty list_.

Operations:

- `PrintList`

- `MakeEmpty`

- `Find`: returns the position of the first occurrence of a key

- `insert`/`Delete`: generally insert and delete some key from some position in the list

- `FindKth`

#### Implementation

##### Simple Array Implementation

This usually requires high overestimate, which wastes considerable space. Insertion and deletion are expensive. Simple arrays are generally not used to implement lists

##### Linked lists

It consists of a series of structures, of which each contains the element and a pointer to a structure containing its successor. A doubly linked list has a pointer to the predecessor. A circularly linked list has the last cell keep a pointer back to the first and vice versa.

For a singly linked list, `PrintList(L)` and `Find(L,Key)` takes linear time. `FindKth` takes $O(i)$ time and works by traversing down the list. `Delete()` can be executed in one pointer change. `Insert` requires a `malloc` call and two pointer maneuvers. We can keep a dummy header node, which is common practice.
